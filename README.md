## User Experience
We considered enhanced quality of the experience when holidays and trips have been well thought out and planned.
A good budget planning tool is a necessity. The Dara Planner tool was conceived to meet this requirement.

### User stories

Epics were logged in the project issues under [epics](https://github.com/ibuttimer/in-for-a-penny/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aepic)

## Technology:

- Django
- Materialize

Initially Tailwind CSS was chosen, as the frontend framework, however the implementation proved troublesome and the decision was made to switch to Materialize.

* Python
    * Backend coding
* Javascript, HTML, CSS
    * Frontend coding

* Assorted IDEs
    * Intellij IDEA, Gitpod, GitLabs, VSCode

## Initial MVP idea:

The team selected the idea of a budget planning tool from among a number of ideas discussed.
- [planning.md](doc/planning/planning.md)
- [meeting-log.md](doc/planning/meeting-log.md)

### Actual idea & content:

The final project meets the requirement of providing a budgeting tool with support for multiple currencies.

User authentication and authorisation was included in the initial MVP, and was functional but has been excluded from the final product as
there was insufficient time to properly style the register and login templates.

The application provides the following functionality
- Budget planner with the following features
  - Budget base currency
  - Expense entries with individual currency settings
  - Budget total calculated in base currency
  - Budget creation/view/update/delete
- Currency convertor allowing conversion of amount between two currencies
- Useful travel link page

## Deployment
### Development and Local Deployment
#### Environment
The development environment requires:

| Artifact                                 | Download and installation instructions               |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| [git](https://git-scm.com/)              | https://git-scm.com/downloads                        |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/)        | https://www.python.org/downloads/                    |
| [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) | https://www.djangoproject.com/download/              |

#### Setup
##### Clone Repository
In an appropriate folder, run the following commands:
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/ibuttimer/in-for-a-penny.git
> cd in-for-a-penny
```
Alternatively, most IDEs provide an option to create a project from Version Control.

#### Virtual Environment
It is recommended that a virtual environment be used for development purposes.
Please see [Creating a virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) for details.

> __Note:__ Make sure to [activate the virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#activating-a-virtual-environment).

#### Python Setup
In the `in-for-a-penny` folder, run the following command to install the necessary python packages:
```shell
> pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```
##### Production versus Development Setup
There are two requirements files:
* [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) which installs the production requirements, and
* [requirements-dev.txt](requirements-dev.txt) which installs extra development-only requirements in addition to the production requirements from [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)

#### Environment variables
Set environment variables corresponding to the keys in [Table 1: Configuration settings](#table-1-configuration-settings).

E.g.
```shell
For Linux and Mac:                       For Windows:
$ export DEVELOPMENT=true                > set DEVELOPMENT=true
```

##### Secret Key Generation
A convenient method of generating a secret key is to run the following command and copy its output.

```shell
$ python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
```

### Before first run
Before running the application for the first time following cloning from the repository and setting up a new database,
the following steps must be performed, from a terminal window, in the `in-for-a-penny` folder.

#### Initialise the database
````shell
$ python manage.py migrate
````

#### Create a superuser
Enter `Username`, `Password` and optionally `Email address`.
````shell
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
````

#### Configure authentication
From [django-allauth Post-Installation](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#post-installation)
- Add a Site for your domain in the database
  - Login to `http://<domain>/admin/sites/site/` as the previously created superuser, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/sites/site/
  - Add a Site for your domain (django.contrib.sites app) or edit the default entry `example.com`.

    E.g.

    | Domain name | Display name |
    |-------------|--------------| 
    | localhost   | localhost    | 

    __Note:__ The id (primary key) of the site must be added to the application configuration. See `SITE_ID` in [Table 1: Configuration settings](#table-1-configuration-settings).

### Run server
In order to run the development server, run the following commands from the `in-for-a-penny` folder:

````shell
# start server
$ python manage.py runserver
````

By default, the server runs on port 8000 on the IP address 127.0.0.1.
See [runserver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/django-admin/#runserver) for details on passing an IP address and port number explicitly.

### Cloud-based Deployment
#### Heroku

The site was deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

##### Deployment
The following steps were followed to deploy the website:
- Login to Heroku in a browser
- From the dashboard select `New -> Create new app`
- Set the value for `App name`, (e.g. `dara-planner`), choose the appropriate region and click `Create app`
- To provision the application with a database, such as an [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) database.
  - For an [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) database, follow the `Create a new instance` instructions under the `Getting started` section of the [ElephantSQL documentation](https://www.elephantsql.com/docs/index.html).
- From the app settings, select the `Resources` tab.
  - Under `Add-ons` add the following
    1. `Cloudinary - Image and Video Management` - [Cloudinary Image & Video Tools](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/cloudinary)

       __Note:__ In order the access the dashboard for the provisioned Cloudinary account, use the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/cloudinary#management-console)
          ```shell
          $ heroku addons:open cloudinary --app=dara-planner
          ```

- From the app settings, select the `Settings` tab.
  - Under `Buildpacks` add the following buildpacks

- From the app settings, select the `Deploy` tab.
  - For the `Deployment method`, select `GitHub` and link the Heroku app to the GitHub repository.

    __Note:__ To configure GitHub integration, you have to authenticate with GitHub. You only have to do this once per Heroku account. See [GitHub Integration (Heroku GitHub Deploys)](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration).
  - `Enable Automatic Deploys` under `Automatic deploys` to enable automatic deploys from GitHub following a GitHub push if desired.
  - The application may also be deployed manually using `Deploy Branch` under `Manual deploy`

- Initialise the database and Create a superuser

  Involves the same procedure as outlined in [Initialise the database](#initialise-the-database) and [Create a superuser](#create-a-superuser)
  but may be run from the local machine.
  - From a [Development and Local Deployment](#development-and-local-deployment)
    - Initialise the database
      ````shell
      $ python manage.py migrate --database=remote
      ````
    - Create a superuser

      Enter `Username`, `Password` and optionally `Email address`.
      ````shell
      $ python manage.py createsuperuser --database=remote
      ````

    __Note:__ Ensure to specify the `--database=remote` option to apply the change to the database specified by the `REMOTE_DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

  - Alternatively, the [Heroku CLI](#heroku-cli) may be utilised.

    After logging into the Heroku CLI in a terminal window, in the `in-for-a-penny` folder:
    - Initialise the database
      ````shell
      $  heroku run python manage.py migrate --app dara-planner
      ````
    - Create a superuser

      Enter `Username`, `Password` and optionally `Email address`.
      ````shell
      $ heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser --app dara-planner
      ````
- Configure authentication

  Follow the same procedure as outlined in [Configure authentication](#configure-authentication) using the
  Heroku domain as `<domain>`, e.g. `dara-planner.herokuapp.com`
